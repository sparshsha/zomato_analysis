# Zomato Analysis Project

In the "Zomato Analysis" project, I delved into Zomato sales data, leveraging SQL queries to extract valuable insights. Explore customer behaviors, product performance, and key metrics such as total amount spent, frequency of visits, and popular items. The provided queries offer a comprehensive view, contributing meaningful perspectives to understand and optimize Zomato's operations. Dive into the details to uncover patterns that drive success in the dynamic world of food delivery.

Feel free to interact with the SQL queries and discover more about the intriguing dynamics of Zomato's sales landscape.
